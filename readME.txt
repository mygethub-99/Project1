your guess is as good as mine.

In python gui:
	Click on File, open file, and browse to find 

entertainment_center_part2.py file (file should be where you unzipped 

entertainment.zip file).
Once file is open...
press F5 to run the python code.

workingdirectory and then open it in your default internet browser.
